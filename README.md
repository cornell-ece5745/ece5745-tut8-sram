ECE 5745 Tutorial 8: SRAM Generators
==========================================================================

This repository contains the code and documentation for ECE 5745 Tutorial
8 on SRAM generators. The tutorial describes how to use both the Synopsys
Educational memory generator to generate actual layout as well as how to
use a CACTI memory generator to generate larger SRAMs that better match
the needs of this course. The tutorial explains how to use SRAMs in your
RTL, how to generate the corresponding SRAM macros, and then how to push
a design which uses these macros through the ASIC toolflow.
